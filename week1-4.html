    <h1>Week 1-4 GC Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>Over the course of week 1, we covered the following:</p>
    <ul>
        
            <strong><h1>Monday</h1></strong> 
            <h2>Object-oriented programming, data types, and variables.</h2>
            <p>Object oriented programming is a programming methodology based around creating objects with attributes and methods which
            can be called upon, an example of a method would be "console.log()" and calling upon an attribute would look like
            "objectName.attributeName". data types are the types of data that can be stored in a variable and the common data types
            are as follows:
            String: A sequence of characters.
            Number: A numeric value.
            Bigint: An exceedingly large numeric value.
            Boolean: Represents a binary choice, either True or False.
            Undefined: Signifies that the data type hasn't been initialized.
            Null: Indicates that the data type was initialized but holds an empty value.
            Object: A data type that can reference other data types and functions.</p>
        
        
            <strong><h1>Tuesday:</strong></h1> Coding fundamentals, computational thinking, and the concept of variables.
            <p>Coding fundamentals can be broken down into 3 main categories:

                Sequence - the order in which code is run
                Selection - which code is run based on different conditions
                Iteration - looping sections of code instead of writing it out multiple times
                A variable is a storage container for a single piece of data such as a string or a number</p>
        
      
            <strong><h1>Wednesday:</strong></h1> Selectors, if and else statements, and working with arrays.
            <p>The most common way to select which code to run is an if statement which has the following syntax "if (condition) {code
            to execute if true}". If statements are often followed by an else statement which looks like "else {code to run if
            consition is false}".
            
            Arrays are a data type that are a sort of list of variables, to initialize an array you can put "arrayName =
            [example1,example2,example3]"(you can also initialize them with empty square brackets), you can access and alter an
            array using "arrayName[index]" where index is the location in the list starting from 0</p>
      
      
            <strong><h1>Thursday:</strong></h1> For and while loops, functions, and their declaration.
            <p>There are 2 main loops that people use when programming:
            
            For Loop - a loop that runs a set number of times and is formatted as: "for ((initializer)let i = 0;(condition) i <
                10;(iterator) i++) {code to run each iteration}" While Loop - a loop that runs until a condition is no longer true
                and is written as: "while (condition) {code to be run}" Functions are snippets of code that can be run by being
                called upon as well as taking parameters to produce a desired outcome, there are multiple ways to declare a function
                but my preferred way is "function functionName(parameter1,parameter2) {code to be run}" . To call upon a function
                you can use the following syntax: "functionName(input1,input2)" , the number of parameters a function can have are
                not limited and can be 0 or over a hundred depending on its use</p>
      
       
            <strong><h1>Friday:</strong></h1> Completion of JavaScript challenges focusing on functions and array manipulation.
            <p>The javascript challenges were basic challenges focused around functions and array manipulation</p>
