    <h1>Week 1-4 GC Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>Over the course of week 1, we covered the following:</p>
    <ul>
        
            <strong><h1>Monday</h1></strong> 
            <h2>Object-oriented programming, data types, and variables.</h2>
            <p>Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code that's based on creating objects. These objects have features (like characteristics and actions), which you can use. For example, a "console.log()" is an action (or method), and accessing a feature of an object might look like "objectName.attributeName."

                In programming, we deal with different types of data. Here are some common data types:
                
                String: It's a bunch of characters put together.
                Number: It's a numeric value, like 1 or 3.14.
                Bigint: This is for really, really big numbers.
                Boolean: It's like a switch with only two options - either "True" or "False."
                Undefined: It's used when something doesn't have a value yet.
                Null: It means something has a value, but that value is empty or nothing.
                Object: This is like a container that can hold other types of data and actions.</p>
        
        
            <strong><h1>Tuesday:</strong></h1> 
            <h2> fundamentals, computational thinking, and the concept of variables.</h2>
            <p>Coding basics can be divided into three main parts:

                Sequence: It's all about the order in which code is executed.
                
                Selection: This deals with choosing which code to run based on specific conditions or choices.
                
                Iteration: It's like repeating sections of code to avoid writing the same thing multiple times.
                
                A variable is like a storage box for holding a single piece of data, like a word or a number.</p>
        
      
            <strong><h1>Wednesday:</strong></h1> <h2> Selectors, if and else statements, and working with arrays.</h2>
            <p>The most common way to choose which code to run is by using an "if statement." It looks like this: "if (condition) {code to execute if the condition is true}."

                Sometimes, you follow the "if statement" with an "else statement" that goes like this: "else {code to run if the condition is false.}"
                
                Now, let's talk about arrays. They are like lists of variables. To create an array, you can do it like this: "arrayName = [example1, example2, example3]" (you can also make an empty array using square brackets). To work with an array, you can use "arrayName[index]" where the index is the position in the list, starting from 0.</p>
      
      
            <strong><h1>Thursday:</strong></h1><h2>For and while loops, functions, and their declaration.</h2>
            <p>In programming, there are two main types of loops:

                For Loop: This loop runs a specific number of times. It's written like this: "for (initializer; condition; iterator) {code to run in each iteration}." For example, "for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {code}" means the loop will run 10 times.
                
                While Loop: This loop continues to run as long as a certain condition remains true. It's structured as: "while (condition) {code to be run}." It keeps going until the condition becomes false.
                
                Now, let's talk about functions. They are like reusable pieces of code that you can run by calling them. Functions can take some input (called parameters) and produce a specific result. Here's one way to declare a function: "function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {code to be run}." To use a function, you call it like this: "functionName(input1, input2)." Functions can have any number of parameters, from none to many, depending on what you need them to do.</p>
      
       
            <strong><h1>Friday:</strong></h1> <h2>Completed JavaScript challenges focusing on functions and array methods.</h2>
            <p>The JavaScript challenges were simple tasks that mainly revolved around working with functions and manipulating arrays.</p>
