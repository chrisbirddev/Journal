    </p>
    <p>this has been very challenging and interesting im not putting a lot of hours into it. Its more when Im arsed doing it. </p>

    <h2>Learning React</h2>
    <p>Had my sister over on the weekend and we gone over quite a few stuff you can you in react but is javascript. A strong
    base with Javascript Vanilla is good and its necessary in order to do stuff in react. </p>
    <p>Not gonna put any screenshots just now cause the whole thing is in my laptop and I can be bothered right now to go push
    and pull in this windows machine. Is not ready anyway</p> 
    <h2>Personal Portifolio</h2>
    <p>Sometime this week Ill be starting my own personal portifolio. Every single dev in the world has got one and ill make one.</p>
    <p>I will like working on that as there is a large amount of templates available on the internet that you can base yourself of and work from there.</p>
    <p>I do want to start building a good portifolio and have it ready for possible employers to take a look at it. </p>
